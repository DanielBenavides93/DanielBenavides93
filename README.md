## Hi, I’m Daniel!

Android Engineer specialized in Kotlin. I’ve been building Android apps for about three years, combining hands-on product development with two years of freelance experience modernizing real-world applications. One of my key projects was supporting the migration of a banking app with significant legacy code: we consolidated navigation using fragments, proposed new interfaces in Jetpack Compose that were accepted, and designed a modular structure aligned with Clean Architecture so the team could deliver features in parallel. I’m very focused on building stable, scalable, and maintainable apps, improving performance, reducing crashes, and keeping codebases easy to evolve over time. I enjoy collaborating with product and design to turn requirements into clean technical solutions, and I’m comfortable working across the full Android development lifecycle: architecture decisions, API integration, debugging, refactoring, and shipping improvements.


## What I do:
- **Android Development (Kotlin)**: Jetpack, MVVM, Clean Architecture
- **UI**: Jetpack Compose + Material Design
- **Async & Data**: Coroutines, Flow, Retrofit/OkHttp
- **Architecture**: Modularization, DI (Koin/Hilt), SOLID principles
- **Quality**: Unit testing, debugging, performance optimization, crash reduction
- **Delivery**: Git, CI/CD basics, release support


## Highlights:
- Migrated and modernized Android features from legacy codebases
- Proposed and shipped new screens in **Jetpack Compose**
- Helped design **modular Clean Architecture** to speed up delivery and reduce crashes


## Tech Stack:
**Kotlin • Android SDK • Jetpack Compose • MVVM • Clean Architecture • Coroutines/Flow • Retrofit/OkHttp • Git**
